# Java-OpenVPN-Client

An OpenVPN Client created using Java during our second year of university as our final project for our CSE 4402 course.

Collaboration between **Sajid Ahmed Chowdhury**, **Salman Sajid** and **Shaikh Faiyaz Karim**.

Steps to run this Client using a Java IDE:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install `OpenVPN` on your computer from the given link: [Community Downloads | OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/community-downloads/).
3. Set up your own private cloud servers using websites such as [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?trk=acf560a9-b654-4d6f-8de4-b78320a9711f&sc_channel=ps&sc_campaign=acquisition&sc_medium=ACQ-P|PS-GO|Brand|Desktop|SU|Core-Main|Core|BD|EN|Text&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!457516401268!e!!g!!aws&ef_id=EAIaIQobChMI0oD0-sug9wIVAZNmAh0JngbLEAAYASAAEgKqfPD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!457516401268!e!!g!!aws), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/gcp/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=japac-AU-all-en-dr-bkws-all-all-trial-b-dr-1009882&utm_content=text-ad-none-none-DEV_c-CRE_505019683192-ADGP_Hybrid%20%7C%20BKWS%20-%20PHR%20%7C%20Txt%20~%20GCP%20~%20General_cloud%20-%20Keyword%20cloud%20google-KWID_43700065771633660-aud-1644542955988%3Akwd-15700998568&userloc_9069450-network_g&utm_term=KW_cloud%20google&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8uD6i8yg9wIVJJNmAh0YsgobEAAYASAAEgJXE_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) etc or you may get free servers from websites such as [VPN Gate](https://www.vpngate.net/en/).
